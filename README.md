# sure-start-working-paper1
Data and code to used to produce the analysis used in the Sure Start protocol and working paper. See https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/AY683


# How to use 

1. Install R dependencies

```{r}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rJava", "xlsx"))
```
2. Run the code in the `makeFiles` folder to get cleaned version of the raw data (stored in `outputs`). 
3. Files in the main folder with the prefix `protocol` do the analysis (saved in `outputs`). 
4. (optional) Files with the prefix `source` contain code for specific repetitive analysis tasks (e.g. make graphs, run models).

# Data

Raw data is kept in the `data` folder. Processed and cleaned data for analysis is kept in `outputs` folder.

## Non-open data

One key dataset is not shared in this repo but described below:

- Development of Sure Start Coverage Table.XLSX: This was sent by the NI Department of Education. Worksheet 1 contains their records of Sure Start areas and their timing. Worksheet 2 is a cleaned and reformatted version which contains key variables:
  - soa_nimd: name of SOA for linkage to imd
  - Phase.included: which phase a particular SOA was included
